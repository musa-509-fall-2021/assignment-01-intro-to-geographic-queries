1. [How many bike trips in Q2 2019?](query01.sql)

    This file is filled out for you, as an example.

    ```SQL
    SELECT count(*)
    FROM indego_trips_2019_q2
    ```

    **Result:** 206354

2. [What is the percent change in trips in Q2 2020 as compared to Q2 2019?](query02.sql)
    _Bonus: If you want to get fancier here, you can cast the result to a string and concatenate a `'%'` to the end. For example, `(10 + 3.2)::text || '%' AS perc_change`. This uses the type casting (number to string) and string concatenation operator (`||`, double pipes) that's essentially a `+` for strings._
    ```SQL
    SELECT count(*)
    FROM indego_trips_2019_q2
    ```
    Returned with 186586, then:
    ```SQL
    SELECT  
    100.0*(186586 - 206354) / 206354 As PercentDiff
