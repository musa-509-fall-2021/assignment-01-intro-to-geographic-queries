## Datasets

* Indego Bikeshare data station status data
* Indego Trip data
  - Q2 2020
  - Q2 2019

All data is available from [Indego's Data site](https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/).

Load all three datasets into your CARTO account.

Fork this repository and fill in each of the SQL files corresponding to the questions below. Submit a pull request back to the original repository with your answers.

1. [How many bike trips in Q2 2019?](query01.sql)

    This file is filled out for you, as an example.

    ```SQL
    SELECT count(*)
    FROM indego_trips_2019_q2
    ```

    **Result:** 206354

2. [What is the percent change in trips in Q2 2020 as compared to Q2 2019?](query02.sql)
    _Bonus: If you want to get fancier here, you can cast the result to a string and concatenate a `'%'` to the end. For example, `(10 + 3.2)::text || '%' AS perc_change`. This uses the type casting (number to string) and string concatenation operator (`||`, double pipes) that's essentially a `+` for strings._

3. [What is the average duration of a trip for 2019?](query03.sql)

4. [What is the average duration of a trip for 2020?](query04.sql)

    _What do you notice about the difference in trip lengths? Give a few explanations for why there could be a difference here._

    **Answer:**
    Despite the fact that the number of trips decreased by 9% from 2019 to 2020, the average duration was 16 minutes longer in 2020 than it was in 2019.  The pandemic is likely the reason for the decline in trips - riders were staying home.  However, the pandemic could also account for the longer rides.  Riders may have been uncomfortable taking public transit or uber/lyft, so when riders needed to get somewhere (which was less often) they biked, even if it was further than they would normally bike.  Additionally, since gyms closed due to COVID-19, perhaps riders used the bikes for exercise as well.  Rides for exercise might be longer than rides for travel. 
    Alternatively, the price structure of rides might have changed, unrelated to the pandemic, and longer rides might be cheaper in 2020 than 2019.

5. [What is the longest duration trip?](query05.sql)

    _Why are there so many trips of this duration?_

    **Answer:**
    There are 1440 minutes in a day.  From looking at some of the values in the start_time and end_time columns it is clear that any ride that lasted longer than a full day is considered 1440 minutes.  Therefore there are many rides with a duration of 1440 because the duration maxes out at that number.

6. [How many trips were shorter than 10 minutes?](query06.sql)

7. [How many trips started on one day and ended in the next?](query07.sql)

    _Hint 1: date strings can be parsed using the text type to datetime type conversion function [`to_timestamp`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-formatting.html). See the section on [Template Patterns for Date/Time Formatting](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-formatting.html#FUNCTIONS-FORMATTING-DATETIME-TABLE) for options on choosing the right string format. The 2020 dataset has the timestamp in a slightly unusual format so you need to tell PostgreSQL how to parse it. The 2019 data should already be in a good format._

    _Hint 2: Days of the month can be retrieved from a timestamp using the [EXTRACT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT) function. See also some of the follow alongs from the Lecture in week 2._

8. [Give the five most popular starting stations between 7am and 10am in 2019.](query08.sql)

    _Hint: Use the `EXTRACT` function to get the hour of the day from the timestamp._

9. [List all the passholder types and number of trips for each.](query09.sql)

10. [Using the station status dataset, find the distance in meters of all stations from Meyerson Hall.](query10.sql)

11. [What is the average distance (in meters) of all stations from Meyerson Hall?](query11.sql)

12. [How many stations are within 1km of Meyerson Hall?](query12.sql)

13. [Which station is furthest from Meyerson Hall?](query13.sql)

14. [Which station is closest to Meyerson Hall?](query14.sql)
