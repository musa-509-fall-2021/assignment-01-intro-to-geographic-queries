------- Solution 1: using Q1 -------

SELECT  ROUND((COUNT(*)::numeric - 206354) / 206354,3)::text || '%' 
AS percentage_change
FROM indego_trips_2020_q2

------- Solution 2: without using Q1 -------

WITH count2019 AS
(
  SELECT COUNT(*)::numeric AS count2019
  FROM indego_trips_2019_q2
), count2020 AS
(
  SELECT COUNT(*)::numeric AS count2020
  FROM indego_trips_2020_q2
)
SELECT ROUND(((count2020 - count2019) / count2019), 3) ::text || '%' 
AS percentage_change
FROM count2019, count2020

/*
  Bonus: If you want to get fancier here, you can cast the result to a string
  and concatenate a '%' to the end. For example:

      (10 + 3.2)::text || '%' AS perc_change

  This uses the type casting (number to string) and string concatenation
  operator (`||`, double pipes) that's essentially a `+` for strings.
