/*
  Bonus: If you want to get fancier here, you can cast the result to a string
  and concatenate a '%' to the end. For example:

      (10 + 3.2)::text || '%' AS perc_change

  This uses the type casting (number to string) and string concatenation
  operator (`||`, double pipes) that's essentially a `+` for strings.
